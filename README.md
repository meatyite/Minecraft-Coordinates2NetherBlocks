# Minecraft-Coordinates2NetherBlocks
A Tool that allows minecraft players to calculate how many blocks you need to walk in the nether to get to a 
specific coordinate in the overworld. <br/>
You can use this along with chunkbase to travel around your minecraft world to anywhere you want.

This was tested on Minecraft Java 1.14.3, and indeed it works.
